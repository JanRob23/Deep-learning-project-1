# DeepLearningProject1
In this project we tested a CNN and and ensemble of MLPs on the classical MNIST dataset.
The follwing code is included in the different files:
  - functions: training, evaluating and the function that combines the output from the MLPs
  - linear_nets: The implementation of the different MLPs
  - CNNs: implementation of LeNet5 and an a deeper version of LeNet5
  - plots_and_stuff: function to plot train and test performance
  - fileIO: reading in the data
  - launch: here all functions are called and the go function is implemented to run the project from google colab

Disclaimer: Due to having progress bars for notebooks (google colab) this code might give an error when run without using notebooks
